create new migrations for each change (if needed) like add table, insert roles, add role id

exports.up = async (sql) => {
  await sql`
CREATE TABLE roles(
  id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50)
)
`;
}

exports.down = async (sql) => {
  await sql`
    DROP TABLE roles
  `;
}

and then the next ones instead of create table:
in up:
const roles = [
  {name: 'Founder'},
  {name: 'Developer'},
  {name: 'Marketing'}
]
INSERT INTO roles ${sql(roles, 'name')}`;

and in down:
for (const role of roles) {
  await sql`
  DELETE FROM
  roles
  WHERE
  name = ${role.name}
  `;
}

and then to add stuff from another table in this version to an existing table
ALTER TABLE
  team_members
ADD COLUMN
  role_id INT REFERENCES roles (id)

and in down
ALTER TABLE
  team_members
DROP COLUMN
  role_id
